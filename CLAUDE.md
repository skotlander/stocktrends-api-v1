# CLAUDE.md — Stock Trends API

## Purpose

This repository powers the Stock Trends API and agent monetization system.

This is a **production financial system**, not a simple API.

It must preserve:
- pricing correctness (STC)
- payment rail integrity
- complete logging/metering
- system stability
- architectural consistency with `/docs` and `AGENTS.md`

---

## DOCUMENT HIERARCHY (CRITICAL)

Understand the separation of concerns:

- `/docs` → system truth (strategy, architecture, operations)
- `AGENTS.md` → non-negotiable system rules
- `CLAUDE.md` → execution behavior

### Rule:

If anything is unclear:

1. Check `/docs`
2. Then `AGENTS.md`
3. Then proceed

Never override documented system design.

---

## MANDATORY FIRST STEP

Before making ANY changes:

1. Read:
   - `AGENTS.md`
   - Relevant `/docs` files (architecture, lifecycle, pricing if applicable)

2. Confirm:
   - pricing model = STC only
   - no rail-specific pricing logic
   - logging is mandatory

3. If unclear → ASK QUESTIONS before proceeding

---

## BIDIRECTIONAL ALIGNMENT (REQUIRED)

Before coding:

1. State what you think the task is
2. List assumptions
3. Identify affected system layers:
   - pricing
   - payment
   - middleware
   - logging

4. Ask clarifying questions if anything is ambiguous

Do NOT proceed until alignment is confirmed.

---

## PLAN MODE (MANDATORY)

For ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps, debugging, architecture, payments):

1. Produce a structured plan BEFORE implementation
2. Wait for confirmation before coding

Plan MUST include:
- objective
- exact layers impacted
- step-by-step execution
- risks
- validation strategy

If something breaks or deviates:
→ STOP and re-plan

---

## EXECUTION RULES

- Make minimal, targeted changes
- Preserve production behavior
- Do NOT rewrite large sections unnecessarily

STRICT separation:

- pricing (STC)
- payment rails
- enforcement logic
- logging/metering

Never mix these concerns.

---

## CORE SYSTEM INVARIANTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Derived from `AGENTS.md`:

### 1. STC is the ONLY pricing source
- all endpoints resolve to STC
- no pricing in payment adapters
- no rail-specific pricing

### 2. Payment rails are interchangeable (ALL ACTIVE)

- subscription
- x402
- MPP (production)
- STOK (future incentive layer)

### 3. Logging is mandatory

Every request MUST produce:
- stc_cost
- pricing_rule_id
- payment_rail
- payment_status

No logging = invalid system state

---

## SUBSYSTEM ISOLATION (CRITICAL)

The system has distinct layers:

1. pricing resolution
2. payment translation
3. payment verification
4. enforcement
5. logging/metering

### Rules:

- NEVER combine layers
- NEVER embed pricing in payment logic
- NEVER embed payment logic in routes
- NEVER bypass logging

If a bug exists:
→ fix ONLY the responsible layer

---

## REQUEST LIFECYCLE AWARENESS

All changes must respect the lifecycle:

1. authentication
2. pricing resolution (STC)
3. payment path selection
4. payment enforcement
5. endpoint execution
6. logging/metering
7. response

Reference:
→ `/docs/architecture/request-lifecycle.md`

Any violation of this flow is a bug.

---

## PAYMENT MODEL AWARENESS (UPDATED)

The system supports MULTIPLE ACTIVE payment paths:

### Subscription
- STC deducted from account balance

### x402 (per-request)
- payment validated per request
- uses challenge/verify flow

### MPP (session-based, PRODUCTION)
- STC deducted from session balance
- may NOT follow x402 challenge flow
- requires session tracking and state consistency

### Key Rule

Do NOT assume:
- all payments are request-based
- all payments use headers like x402

MPP requires different reasoning.

---

## VERIFICATION BEFORE COMPLETION (MANDATORY)

Never mark work complete without proof:

### Must verify:

- correct STC cost applied
- correct payment rail selected
- correct enforcement behavior

### MUST validate ALL ACTIVE RAILS when impacted:

- subscription path
- x402 path
- MPP session path

### Always validate:

- `/v1/` responds
- `/v1/docs` loads
- `/v1/openapi.json` loads

Ask:
"Would this pass a production audit?"

---

## DEBUGGING DISCIPLINE (MANDATORY)

Always identify the failure layer FIRST:

1. nginx
2. service startup
3. FastAPI app
4. pricing
5. middleware
6. payment translation
7. payment verification
8. logging

### Additional Rule:

Identify WHICH PAYMENT RAIL is involved:

- subscription
- x402
- MPP

Fix:
→ the correct rail + correct layer

---

## PAYMENT ARCHITECTURE RULES

- Pricing must be resolved BEFORE payment logic
- Payment rails must consume STC
- Payment adapters must be modular

Never:
- hardcode pricing
- assume x402-only system
- treat MPP like x402
- collapse multi-rail logic into shortcuts

---

## LOGGING DISCIPLINE (FIRST-CLASS)

Every request must be:

- logged once
- logged accurately
- aligned with actual behavior

Logging must reflect:
- real enforcement outcome
- real payment state
- correct rail (subscription | x402 | mpp)

---

## DEMAND ELEGANCE (MANDATORY CHECKPOINT)

For any non-trivial change:

Ask:
"Is this aligned with the system architecture in /docs?"

Avoid:
- hacks
- duplication
- bypassing lifecycle

---

## AUTONOMOUS DEBUGGING

When given a bug:

- inspect logs
- inspect request lifecycle
- identify payment rail
- trace execution path

Fix:
→ root cause at correct layer

---

## SELF-IMPROVEMENT LOOP

After any failure:

Record in:
tasks/lessons.md

Include:
- problem
- root cause
- prevention rule

Focus especially on:
- payment bugs
- logging gaps
- pricing inconsistencies

---

## CONTEXT DISCIPLINE

- Avoid long sessions
- Do not rely on stale context
- Re-check `/docs` when unsure

---

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Always provide:

1. diagnosis
2. files changed
3. exact code changes
4. reasoning
5. validation steps
6. risks

---

## DO NOT

- break payment enforcement
- remove logging
- hardcode pricing
- assume a single payment rail
- treat MPP as x402
- introduce breaking API changes

---

## DEFINITION OF DONE

A task is complete ONLY when:

- STC pricing is correct
- ALL payment rails behave correctly
- logging is complete
- lifecycle is preserved
- validation confirms real behavior

---

## FINAL PRINCIPLE

This system is:

- a pricing engine (STC)
- a multi-rail payment system
- an agent monetization layer

It must behave like a **financial system**, not a typical API.

Priority:
1. pricing correctness
2. payment integrity
3. logging completeness
4. system stability
