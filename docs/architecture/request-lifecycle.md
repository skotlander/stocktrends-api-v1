# Request Lifecycle — Stock Trends API

## Purpose

This document defines the exact lifecycle of an API request, including:

* authentication
* pricing
* payment enforcement
* logging

---

## Step-by-Step Lifecycle

### 0. Endpoint Access Classification

Before implementation, every endpoint must be classified as one of:

* public/free discovery
* protected authenticated
* paid machine-payment

That classification must agree across:

1. Payment Policy Provider
2. Pricing Classifier
3. API-Key Middleware

A zero-cost pricing rule does not override payment-policy enforcement. Public
endpoints must not be registered as payment-gated EndpointPaymentPolicy routes.

Current public/free Stock Trends portfolio endpoints include:

* `GET /v1/stocktrends/portfolios`
* `GET /v1/stocktrends/portfolios/{port_id}`
* `GET /v1/stocktrends/portfolios/{port_id}/returns`
* `GET /v1/stocktrends/portfolios/{port_id}/summary`
* `GET /v1/stocktrends/portfolios/{port_id}/positions/history`
* `GET /v1/stocktrends/strategies`
* `GET /v1/stocktrends/strategies/{strategy_id}`
* `GET /v1/stocktrends/portfolios/{port_id}/strategy`
* `GET /v1/selections/stim-select/outcomes/summary`
* `GET /v1/intelligence/discovery`
* `GET /v1/intelligence/guidance/latest`
* `GET /v1/intelligence/guidance/{artifact_id}`
* `GET /v1/intelligence/research/latest`
* `GET /v1/intelligence/research/{artifact_id}`
* `GET /v1/intelligence/editorial/latest/preview`

The `/v1/intelligence/*` Public Intelligence Artifact Bridge routes are
read-only artifact-serving routes. They consume only exported
`PublicArtifactEnvelope.v1` files referenced by `manifest.json` under
`ST_INTELLIGENCE_ARTIFACTS_DIR`; they do not call Agent graph nodes, Agent
services, generation code, or raw Agent filesystem internals. PR 2 classifies
these exact paths as public/free and non-metered to avoid partial pricing state.
PR 3 will add the intelligence pricing and payment policy for guidance and
research routes.

Official Stock Trends portfolio returns history is sourced from
`stp_returnslog`, the canonical portfolio performance history. Do not
reconstruct portfolio returns from `stp_positions`, which is a holdings/audit
trail source rather than the public performance-history source.

Official Stock Trends historical closed-position records are sourced from
`stp_positions`, filtered to closed rows only:

* `sell_trigger <> ''`

Rows where `sell_trigger = ''` are current live holdings and must remain
protected. Do not make arbitrary `/positions/*` child paths public; only
`/positions/history` is public/free.

Current public response mapping:

* `stp_returnslog.weekdate` -> `returns[].weekdate`
* `stp_returnslog.buys` -> `returns[].buys`
* `stp_returnslog.sells` -> `returns[].sells`
* `stp_returnslog.held` -> `returns[].held`
* `stp_returnslog.net_proceeds` -> `returns[].net_proceeds`
* `stp_returnslog.realizedgain` -> `returns[].realized_gain`
* `stp_returnslog.cum_realizedgain` -> `returns[].cumulative_realized_gain`
* `stp_returnslog.totalvaluation` -> `returns[].total_valuation`
* `stp_returnslog.unrealizedgain` -> `returns[].unrealized_gain`
* `stp_returnslog.cum_totalgain` -> `returns[].cumulative_total_gain`
* `stp_returnslog.tsxindex` -> `returns[].tsx_index`
* `stp_returnslog.spindex` -> `returns[].sp_index`

Current public closed-position mapping:

* `stp_positions.position_id` -> `positions[].position_id`
* `stp_positions.symbol` -> `positions[].symbol`
* `stp_positions.exchange` -> `positions[].exchange`
* `stp_positions.name` -> `positions[].name`
* `stp_positions.date_in` -> `positions[].date_in`
* `stp_positions.price_in` -> `positions[].price_in`
* `stp_positions.qty` -> `positions[].qty`
* `stp_positions.trcost_in` -> `positions[].transaction_cost_in`
* `stp_positions.cost_adjs` -> `positions[].cost_adjustments`
* `stp_positions.total_cost` -> `positions[].total_cost`
* `stp_positions.stop_loss` -> `positions[].stop_loss`
* `stp_positions.date_out` -> `positions[].date_out`
* `stp_positions.weeks_held` -> `positions[].weeks_held`
* `stp_positions.sell_trigger` -> `positions[].sell_trigger`
* `stp_positions.price_out` -> `positions[].price_out`
* `stp_positions.trcost_out` -> `positions[].transaction_cost_out`
* `stp_positions.sell_adjs` -> `positions[].sell_adjustments`
* `stp_positions.total_proceeds` -> `positions[].total_proceeds`
* `stp_positions.gain_loss` -> `positions[].gain_loss`
* `stp_positions.gl_percent` -> `positions[].gain_loss_percent`
* `stp_positions.weekdate` -> `positions[].weekdate`

Do not expose `stp_positions.last_update` in the public closed-position
response.

Official Stock Trends portfolio public history summary is also public/free.
It summarizes:

* active portfolio metadata from `stp_ports WHERE port_id = :port_id AND status = 1`
* public return-history aggregates from `stp_returnslog`
* closed-position aggregates from `stp_positions` filtered to:
  * `sell_trigger IS NOT NULL`
  * `sell_trigger <> ''`

The summary ROI block uses the canonical Stock Trends average-investment method:

```text
avg_investment = avg_net_cost * avg_positions

annualized_roi_percent =
    (total_realized_gain_loss / avg_investment)
    / ((total_weeks * 7) / 365.25)
    * 100
```

For the public summary implementation:

* `total_realized_gain_loss` comes from `SUM(stp_positions.gain_loss)`
* `avg_net_cost` comes from `AVG(stp_positions.total_cost)`
* `avg_positions` is derived from closed position-weeks over elapsed weeks
* `total_weeks` is the elapsed closed-position period from earliest `date_in`
  to latest `date_out` in the filtered closed-position set
* ROI uses the same closed-position filter and `date_out` filters as the
  closed-position summary
* `annualized_roi_percent` is null when `avg_investment` or `total_weeks` is
  zero or null

Current live holdings are excluded from the summary. Do not make arbitrary
`/summary/*` child paths public/free.

Official Stock Trends strategy metadata is public/free provenance metadata. It
is sourced from:

* `Strategy`
* `StrategyCondition`
* `stp_ports.strategy_id`

The canonical mapping is:

```text
stp_ports.strategy_id
    = Strategy.StrategyId
    = StrategyCondition.StrategyId
```

Public strategy metadata exposes declared buy/sell rule rows and economic
assumptions only:

* `Strategy.Description`
* `Strategy.InvestmentAmt`
* `Strategy.TransactionCostPct`
* `Strategy.StopLossPct`
* `Strategy.StopLossMinimum`
* `StrategyCondition.BuySell`
* `StrategyCondition.LeftSide`
* `StrategyCondition.Operator`
* `StrategyCondition.RightSide`
* `StrategyCondition.sell_trigger`

`StrategyCondition.BuySell = 'B'` means a buy-condition row.
`StrategyCondition.BuySell = 'S'` means a sell-condition row.

Strategy conditions are exposed as legacy metadata for provenance and
verification. They are not executable query endpoints. Public strategy metadata
must not evaluate conditions against current market data and must not return
current matching stocks, current buy candidates, current sell candidates, or
current live holdings.

Do not make arbitrary strategy child paths public/free. In particular, these
remain protected unless intentionally reclassified later:

* `/v1/stocktrends/strategies/{strategy_id}/matches`
* `/v1/stocktrends/strategies/{strategy_id}/current`
* `/v1/stocktrends/portfolios/{port_id}/strategy/current`
* `/v1/stocktrends/portfolios/{port_id}/strategy/matches`

Public ST-IM Select signal outcome summary is public/free aggregate evidence.
It summarizes mature historical observations meeting the ST-IM Select
signal-selection rule:

* `stweekly.st_returnmeans.x4wk1 > 0`
* `stweekly.st_returnmeans.x13wk1 > 2.19`
* `stweekly.st_returnmeans.x40wk1 > 6.45`
* `stweekly.st_data.price >= 2`
* `stweekly.st_data.volume > 1000`
* `stweekly.st_data.fpr_chg13 IS NOT NULL`

The endpoint uses the canonical join:

```text
stweekly.st_data.weekdate = stweekly.st_returnmeans.weekdate
AND stweekly.st_data.exchange = stweekly.st_returnmeans.exchange
AND stweekly.st_data.symbol = stweekly.st_returnmeans.symbol
```

The legacy `outcomes` response uses `stweekly.st_data.fpr_chg13` as the realized
13-week forward return. Default no-date responses also expose multi-horizon
historical evidence for `stweekly.st_data.fpr_chg4`, `fpr_chg13`, and
`fpr_chg40`. The endpoint does not reconstruct forward returns from future price
joins. It is not limited to published reports and does not return current
selections, current matching symbols, current candidates, or individual
historical symbols.

When `start_date` and `end_date` are both omitted, the endpoint applies a
trailing 10-year window ending at the latest mature outcome date and returns
`filters.default_window_applied: true` with the applied dates. If either date is
supplied, the endpoint preserves the caller's date range and returns
`filters.default_window_applied: false`.

The default no-date summary is served from the persistent historical summary
table `stweekly.stim_select_outcome_summary`. The API reads this table only; it
does not create, populate, or refresh the table during request handling. Missing
table or missing summary rows return `503` with
`error: outcome_summary_not_available` and `refresh_required: true`.

Refresh may run manually, monthly, weekly, on demand, or after major data
updates with:

```text
python -m maintenance.refresh_stim_select_outcome_summary_cache
```

The table creation SQL is documented in:

```text
docs/operations/stim_select_outcome_summary_table.sql
```

Supported seeded no-date rows are:

* `exchange = NULL`, `limit_rank = NULL`
* `exchange = NULL`, `limit_rank = 10`

Other no-date `limit_rank` or exchange combinations require explicit date
filters or a custom summary refresh. Default responses expose `generated_at`
and `source_latest_mature_weekdate` in
provenance. `generated_at` is when the summary row was produced.
`source_latest_mature_weekdate` is the latest historical signal weekdate
included by the mature-outcome source query.

Explicit date-window requests may still execute the live historical aggregate.
The endpoint is historical evidence for the ST-IM Select signal-selection rule,
not current live selections.

Only this exact path is public/free:

* `/v1/selections/stim-select/outcomes/summary`

Do not make arbitrary ST-IM Select outcome child paths public/free. In
particular, these remain protected unless intentionally reclassified later:

* `/v1/selections/stim-select/outcomes`
* `/v1/selections/stim-select/outcomes/current`
* `/v1/selections/stim-select/outcomes/symbols`

---

### 1. Request Received

Example:

```
GET /v1/stim/latest?symbol_exchange=IBM-N
```

Headers may include:

* API key
* payment headers (x402 / MPP)

---

### 2. Authentication Layer

Checks:

* API key validity
* subscription status
* plan entitlements

Outcomes:

* authenticated → proceed
* invalid → reject (401/403)

---

### 3. Pricing Resolution (STC)

System determines:

* endpoint pricing rule
* STC cost

Example:

```
/stim/latest → 1 STC
```

---

### 4. Payment Path Selection

Based on request context:

#### A. Subscription Path

* no payment headers
* STC deducted from plan allocation

#### B. x402 Path

* payment headers present
* per-request payment validation

#### C. MPP Path

* active session
* STC consumed within session

---

### 5. Payment Enforcement

System validates:

* sufficient STC (subscription)
  OR
* valid payment (x402 / MPP)

Outcomes:

* success → proceed
* failure → `402 Payment Required`

---

### 6. Endpoint Execution

* data fetched
* response generated

---

### 7. Metering + Logging

Record written to:

→ `api_request_economics`

Fields:

* request_id
* customer_id
* api_key_id
* stc_cost
* pricing_rule_id
* payment_rail
* payment_status
* billed_amount_usd

---

### 8. Response Returned

Includes:

* requested data
* payment headers (if applicable)
* request ID for tracking

---

## Payment Status Definitions

| Status            | Meaning                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| covered           | subscription covered usage |
| presented         | billable agent payment     |
| failed_validation | invalid payment attempt    |
| rejected          | request denied             |

---

## Failure Scenarios

### Missing Payment

* no subscription
* no valid payment

→ `402 Payment Required`

---

### Invalid Payment Headers

→ `failed_validation` logged
→ request rejected

---

### Insufficient STC (future enforcement)

→ request rejected or throttled

---

## Observability

All requests must be traceable via:

* `request_id`
* `customer_id`
* `payment_status`

---

## Strategic Outcome

This lifecycle ensures:

* consistent pricing enforcement
* clean separation of concerns
* compatibility with future payment rails

---

## Key Principle

Every request must resolve to STC before execution
