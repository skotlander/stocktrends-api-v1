# Stock Trends Semantic Contract

## Purpose

This document is the authoritative source for all Stock Trends terminology, indicator definitions, and statistical outputs used in the Stock Trends API.

All API descriptions, previews, AI tool manifests, and documentation must adhere strictly to the definitions in this file.

This document exists to prevent ambiguity, inference, or incorrect interpretation of Stock Trends concepts by developers, AI agents, and automated systems.

---

## Core Principle

Stock Trends is **not a raw price data system**.

It is a **structured market intelligence framework** built on:

- trend classification
- relative performance measurement
- volume signal interpretation
- trend maturity tracking
- statistical forward return modeling (STIM)

All outputs are designed for **decision-making**, not raw data retrieval.

---

## Indicator Definitions

### trend

**Definition:**
Categorical classification of a security’s price trend based on the Stock Trends moving average framework.

**Values:**
- `^+` → Bullish
- `^-` → Weak Bullish
- `v^` → Bullish Crossover
- `v-` → Bearish
- `v+` → Weak Bearish
- `^v` → Bearish Crossover

**Interpretation:**
Represents the structural relationship between price and key moving averages.

---

### trend_cnt

**Definition:**
Number of consecutive weeks the security has maintained its current `trend` classification.

**Interpretation:**
Measures **trend persistence**.

Higher values indicate a more established trend.

---

### mt_cnt (trend maturity)

**Definition:**
Number of weeks the security has remained within its broader trend category:

- Bullish category: `^+`, `^-`, `v^`
- Bearish category: `v-`, `v+`, `^v`

**Interpretation:**
Represents **trend maturity** rather than short-term movement.

Used to distinguish:
- early-stage trends
- mature trends
- potential exhaustion conditions

---

### rsi (Relative Strength Indicator)

**Definition:**
Relative performance of the security versus its benchmark (typically S&P 500) over a 13-week period.

**Scale:**
- Baseline = 100

**Interpretation:**
- `> 100` → Outperformance
- `< 100` → Underperformance

---

### rsi_updn

**Definition:**
Directional indicator of weekly relative performance versus benchmark.

**Values:**
- `+` → Outperformed this week
- `-` → Underperformed this week

---

### vol_tag (Unusual Volume Indicator)

**Definition:**
Categorical indicator of abnormal trading volume relative to historical norms.

**Values:**
- `**`, `*` → High volume
- `!!`, `!` → Low volume
- empty → Normal volume

**Interpretation:**
Used to detect:
- accumulation/distribution
- conviction in price movement
- potential inflection points

---

### weekdate

**Definition:**
The week-ending date associated with the observation.

---

### symbol_exchange

**Definition:**
Canonical identifier combining ticker symbol and exchange.

Example: IBM-N


---

## STIM — Stock Trends Inference Model

### Definition

**STIM = Stock Trends Inference Model**

STIM is a statistical model that produces:

- forward return expectations
- statistical distributions of expected returns

across multiple time horizons.

---

### Critical Clarification

STIM is:

- NOT "Stock Trends Intermediate Momentum"
- NOT "Stock Trends Indicator Model"
- NOT a momentum indicator
- NOT derived from simple price changes

STIM is a **probabilistic forward-looking model**.

---

### Time Horizons

STIM produces outputs for:

- 4-week horizon
- 13-week horizon
- 40-week horizon

---

### STIM Fields

Each horizon includes:

#### Example (4-week):

- `x4wk1` → lower bound / percentile estimate
- `x4wk2` → upper bound / percentile estimate
- `x4wk` → expected return (mean)
- `x4wksd` → standard deviation

Equivalent fields exist for:

- `x13wk`, `x13wksd`, etc.
- `x40wk`, `x40wksd`, etc.

---

### Interpretation

STIM outputs represent:

- expected return distributions
- risk (via standard deviation)
- probabilistic forward performance

They are intended for:

- ranking opportunities
- portfolio construction
- probabilistic decision-making

---

## Allowed Terminology

The following phrasing is approved and should be reused:

> "Stock Trends Inference Model (ST-IM) outputs: forward return expectations and statistical distributions across 4-week, 13-week, and 40-week horizons."

---

## Forbidden Terminology

The following must NEVER appear in the codebase:

- "Stock Trends Intermediate Momentum"
- "Stock Trends Indicator Model"
- "momentum values" (when referring to STIM)
- describing STIM as a momentum indicator
- describing Stock Trends as raw price data

---

## Agent and Developer Rules

When modifying or generating:

- API descriptions
- endpoint previews
- `/v1/ai/tools`
- documentation
- OpenAPI specs

You MUST:

1. Use definitions from this document
2. NOT infer or guess meanings
3. NOT expand acronyms unless defined here
4. NOT introduce alternative terminology

---

## Relationship Between Indicators

Stock Trends signals are designed to work together:

- `trend` → structural direction
- `trend_cnt` → persistence
- `mt_cnt` → maturity
- `rsi` → relative performance
- `vol_tag` → volume context
- `STIM` → forward probabilistic expectation

Together, they provide a **multi-dimensional view of market behavior**.

## STIM Select — Stock Trends Inference Model Select

### Definition

**STIM Select = Stock Trends Inference Model Select**

STIM Select stocks are securities whose Stock Trends indicator combinations satisfy the following
statistical criteria across all three ST-IM forward return horizons:

> The lower bound of the mean return confidence interval exceeds the base-period mean random return
> for all three horizons simultaneously.

### Base-Period Mean Random Returns (Thresholds)

| Horizon | Base-Period Mean Random Return |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| 4-week  | 0%                            |
| 13-week | 2.19%                         |
| 40-week | 6.45%                         |

In ST-IM field terms:
- `x4wk1 > 0.00` (lower confidence bound of 4-week expected return exceeds 0%)
- `x13wk1 > 2.19` (lower confidence bound of 13-week expected return exceeds 2.19%)
- `x40wk1 > 6.45` (lower confidence bound of 40-week expected return exceeds 6.45%)

### Ranking

STIM Select stocks are ranked in descending order of:

**Primary ranking metric: `prob13wk`** — probability of exceeding the 13-week base-period mean
random return (2.19%), assuming a normal distribution of returns.

### Publication Threshold

- `prob13wk >= 55%` (minimum 55% probability of exceeding the 13-week base mean)

### Distribution Assumption

- Normal distribution

### Key Field

- `prob13wk` — probability of exceeding the 13-week base-period mean return (primary ranking field)

### API Endpoints

- `GET /v1/selections/latest` — latest STIM Select stock list, ordered by `prob13wk DESC`
- `GET /v1/selections/history` — historical STIM Select records for a symbol or date range
- `GET /v1/selections/published/latest` — published STIM Select list with all three horizon thresholds
  applied (x4wk1, x13wk1, x40wk1) and `prob13wk >= 55%`
- `GET /v1/selections/published/history` — historical published STIM Select records

### Forbidden Terminology

STIM Select must NOT be described as:
- "generic stock selections"
- "stock picks"
- "screener results"
- any description that omits the ST-IM probability and confidence interval criteria
