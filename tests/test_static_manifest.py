Tests for static/tools.json.

Verifies:
1. File is valid JSON
2. Required tools present: stim_latest, stim_history, ai_proof_market_edge
3. Nonexistent tool absent: stim_top (/stim/top does not exist as a route)
4. auth_required corrections: /pricing → false, /workflows → false
5. selections_latest present with correct path
6. selections_published_latest uses correct path (not /selections-published/latest)
7. No hardcoded 'STC per call' in tool descriptions
